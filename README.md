This repository is for my very first personal project. A simple Jan Ken Pon / Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played in the Linux Mint terminal or Windows console. 
--------------------------
Hello there ...
Mabuhay from Tagum City, The Philippines!!!

This is a simple Jan-Ken-Pon game AKA Rock-Paper-Scissors
playable in the Linux terminal or Windows console.
For when you're bored.

Included in this compressed zip file is the source code written in the Python programming language
as well as compiled bytecode. The compiled ones doesn't have icons because for some reason,
my python compiler does not support building icons inside my operating system.

"I am a Linux Mint user, by the way" :P
'cause I'm a newbie in Linux (this is my 3rd month since jumping from MS Windows10 - that TPM req is a b8ch!) and in Python (I'm forced to learn this language coz, dang it! I missed AutoHotkey on Windows).
And boy! This is my very minute on Github! Why am I even here?

(I don't even know what I'm saying at this point)
:P

Anyways, hope you enjoy this simple game.

Special Thanks to Thuận tập viết Code for contributions to my first Jan-Ken-Pon code.
